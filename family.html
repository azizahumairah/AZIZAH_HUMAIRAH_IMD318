    <p>I was born into a loving family with two wonderful and supportive parents, Che Sofian and Mazlan,
	who have always been my biggest source of strength and comfort. Growing up, I was surrounded by care, guidance,
	and warmth, which shaped who I am today. I have four siblings, and I am the youngest in the family, something that
	has always made me feel especially protected and cherished. The eldest is my brother, Mohd Farhan, who has always 
	been a role model to me. The second is my brother, Mohd Zulhilmi, who is married to his wife, Alia, and together they 
	have a beautiful child named Anis Zulaika. She is my sweet little baby, and my heart truly melts every time she calls me “makcu,”
	a moment that never fails to make me smile and feel deeply loved. The third sibling is my sister, Nadwa Farhana, who is hardworking 
	and inspiring, currently working at Permintex, Jeniang as a Quality Manager. Watching her dedication motivates me to strive for my own 
	goals. Lastly, there is me, the youngest, who is currently in my final semester of a Diploma in Information Management at UiTM Kedah. 
	Being part of this family has taught me the values of love, responsibility, and togetherness, and I am truly grateful for the bond we 
	share and the constant support they give me as I move forward in life.
