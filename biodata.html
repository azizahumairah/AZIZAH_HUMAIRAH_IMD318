</h1>
    <p><h4>Hi! My name is Azizah Humairah 🤍 I was born on 9 March 2005 at Hospital Sik, Kedah, and I’m proudly the youngest of four siblings. 
	Growing up as the youngest shaped me into someone who’s observant, a little playful, and always full of stories. Back in high school, 
	people knew me as Jiji, while in university I go by Maira—a small reminder that life changes, people grow, and it’s always a new era, new me ✨

I’m someone who truly enjoys the little things. I love editing, whether it’s videos, photos, or random creative ideas, and I’m definitely 
a yapper—I can talk about anything once I’m comfortable 😆 Music is my safe space; I listen to it almost everywhere I go. 
My favourite genre is indie, with Empty Page being my favourite local artist. I also have a big soft spot for Indonesian music,
 especially Hindia, .Feast, Panji Sakti, Nadin Amizah, Sal Priadi, and Feby Putri, because their songs feel honest, calming, and a little bit healing.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to podcasts, playing chess when I’m in the mood to think, and spending quality time with my favourite person,
 doing nothing yet feeling everything. I love moments where I can connect with nature—quiet walks, fresh air, and peaceful surroundings help me 
 recharge and feel grounded. As I’m slowly learning how to navigate adulthood, my taste has changed too; these days, I’m more drawn to the colour pink—soft,
 gentle, and comforting. That colour feels like me right now: growing, learning, and becoming more myself every day 💗</h4>

   <span style="font-style: italic:">I’m someone who finds joy in little things and comfort in calm, gentle moments.
   My favourite colour is pink, not just because it’s pretty, but because it feels warm, soft, and safe—like a quiet place I can always return to.
   Pink shows up everywhere in my world, from my personal space to the way I design, write, and dream.

I’ve loved playing chess since my primary school years, when I was first introduced to the game and quickly drawn to its quiet intensity.
 What began as a simple activity soon became something I truly cared about. Chess taught me patience, focus, and the importance of thinking ahead,
 helping me learn how every decision carries weight. Through wins and losses, I grew more reflective and resilient, learning to stay calm under pressure
 and to view challenges as opportunities to improve. The game shaped the way I think, encouraging me to analyse situations carefully and trust my own judgment.

Being selected for KARISMA 2024 was one of the most meaningful moments in my chess journey. It felt like a recognition of years of dedication, practice,
 and quiet perseverance. The experience allowed me to connect with others who share the same passion and reminded me how chess goes beyond competition 
 — it builds character, confidence, and discipline. Even now, chess remains close to my heart, reflecting who I am and continuing to teach me valuable 
 lessons about growth, patience, and determination.</h7>

</h1>
    <p><h7>I have a little mix of brainy, creative, and language skills that reflect who I am 🤍 I can play chess, and I really enjoy how it 
	challenges my thinking, patience, and decision-making (even if I overthink sometimes 😆). I also have experience using C++, HTML, and Java,
	which helped me build a strong foundation in programming and understand how things work behind the scenes, whether it’s logic or simple web structures.

When it comes to languages, I’m fluent in English and comfortable expressing myself in conversations and writing. I also have basic knowledge of Arabic 
and Mandarin, and I enjoy learning new words little by little. On my softer, creative side, I like doing simple drawings and journaling, especially 
when I want to slow down, reflect, or capture my thoughts in a meaningful way. These skills may seem simple, but together they represent my love for learning, 
creating, and growing at my own pace ✨💗
