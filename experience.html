</h1>
    <p><h4>My journey with chess started back in primary school, and it all began in the most unexpected way. One day, Cikgu Azlan randomly asked me 
	to join a chess activity, and that simple moment became the starting point of something truly meaningful in my life. At first, I joined out of curiosity,
	but as I learned more about the game, I slowly fell in love with the thinking, patience, and quiet focus that chess requires. From there, I started joining 
	competitions and managed to achieve several achievements, which motivated me to keep improving and take chess more seriously.

I continued playing chess throughout my high school years, gaining more experience, confidence, and discipline along the way. Chess taught me how to stay calm 
under pressure, think ahead, and trust my own decisions. My highest achievement during this phase was competing at the state level, a milestone that I’m truly 
proud of because it reflected years of effort and growth.

Entering my university era, I chose to continue my chess journey. During my first semester at UiTM Kedah, I joined KARISMA 2024, opening a new chapter 
filled with challenges and meaningful experiences. I had the opportunity to compete at UiTM Rembau alongside an amazing team—Ipah, Aina, Ijul, Amir, Salman, Nik,
 and Faris. We shared moments of nervousness, excitement, and teamwork, reminding me that chess is not only about individual performance but also about supporting one 
 another.

In the same year, I also joined SAF Chess 2024, where I achieved third place, a result that meant a lot to me and further motivated me to keep growing as a player.
 Looking back, chess has accompanied me through different stages of my life—from a random invitation in primary school, to state-level competitions, and now memorable 
 university tournaments. It has shaped my patience, resilience, and confidence, and it remains an important part of my journey ♟️✨
